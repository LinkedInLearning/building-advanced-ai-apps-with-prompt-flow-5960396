# Building Advanced AI Apps with Prompt Flow
This is the repository for the LinkedIn Learning course `Building Advanced AI Apps with Prompt Flow`. The full course is available from [LinkedIn Learning][lil-course-url].

_See the readme file in the main branch for updated instructions and information._
## Instructions
You have two options to follow along with the course:
1. Build your own Prompt Flow from scratch and using the files in `./example-files/.`
2. Watch the course and inspect the completed project files in `./reader-final/.`

## Installing
The quickest way to follow along is by opening this repo in GitHub Codespaces. This provides a preconfigured environment with Python, Docker, and all necessary dependencies and extensions installed and activated. Click the button below to open a new Codespace:

You can also clone this repo and run the app locally in your preferred IDE. To do so you need a local Python environment with all the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` installed:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## AI service dependencies
To run the course examples you need an [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com) subscription. If you want to test out the custom MistralAI integration you also need a [MistralAI](https://console.mistral.ai/) subscription.

Information on how to set up the necessary connections is covered in the course and can also be found in [reader-final/README.md](reader-final/README.md).
